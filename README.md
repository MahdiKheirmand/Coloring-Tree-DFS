# Coloring-Tree-DFS
<br><br><br>
Coloring a given tree(connect acyclic Graph) with following conditions:
<br> 1. No use of prepared Class
<br> 2. if vector A is connect to B and B to C (A-B & B-C)   =>   A & B & C must have diffent Colors
<br> 3.print the minimum colors needed & the color of each vector

<br><br><br>

<h3>Example:</h3>
input:
<br>5 (amount of vectors)
<br>1 2   1 3   2 4   2 5 (edges)
<br><br>output:
<br>4 (minimum color neede)
<br>1 = 1 (number of each vector and its color)
<br>2 = 2
<br>3 = 3
<br>4 = 3
<br>5 = 4
